# Real-Time-Object-Detection-using-Transfer-Learning-Methods
Implemented a real-time object detection system leveraging transfer learning with pre-trained CNN models (Caffe, ResNet-SSD).

Developed the core detection logic to process live video streams, accurately detecting and annotating objects with bounding boxes and class labels.

Integrated Flask, OpenCV, and NumPy to capture, preprocess, and stream video frames to a web interface with user-controlled features (camera toggle, detection on/off, adjustable confidence threshold).
